# The population of salmon next year is given by
# f(S) = Se^r(1 - S / P ),
# where:
# S is this years' salmon population, 
# P is the equilibrium population,
# r is a constant that depends upon how fast the population grows.

# Find f'(S0) and solve the equation f'( S0 ) = 1.
# Graph f'(S0) and y = 1.

# Find the population for which the maximum sustainable harvest occurs if r = 0.4 and P = 850
