# Linear Interpolation

# Some measurements yi, i = 0, ... N (given below) of a quantity y have been collected regularly, once every minute, at times ti = i, 0, 1, ... N.
# We want to fine the value y in between the measurements, e.g., at t = 3.2 min. Computing such y values is called interpolation.

# Let your programs use linear interpolation to compute y between two consecutive measurements:

# Find i such that ti <= t <= ti + 1

# Find a mathematical expression for the straight line that goes through the points (i, yi) and (i+1, yi +1 )

# Compute the y value by inserting the user's time values in the expression for the straight line.
