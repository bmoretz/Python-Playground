# In​ February, a major airline had 77.8​% of their flights arrive on time. Assume that the event that a given flight arrives on time is independent of the event that another flight arrives on time.

# A writer plans to take four separate flights for her publisher next month. Assuming the airline has the same​ on-time performance as in​ February, what is the probability that all four flights arrive on​ time?

prob = .778

round( prob * prob * prob * prob, 4 )
