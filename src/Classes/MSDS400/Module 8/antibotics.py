# Otitis​ media, or middle ear​ infection, is initially treated with an antibiotic. 
# Researchers have compared two​ antibiotics, A and​ B, for their cost effectiveness. 
# 
# A is​ inexpensive, safe, and effective. 
# B is also safe.​ However, it is considerably more expensive and it is generally more effective. 
# 
# Use the tree diagram to the right​ (where the costs are estimated as the total cost of​ medication, office​ visit, ear​ check, and hours of lost​ work) to answer the following.

# A
round( 59.30 * .65 + .35 * 96.15, 2 )

# b
round( 69.15 * .85 + 106.00 * .15, 2 )
